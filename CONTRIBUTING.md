# Thanks for proposing to JupyterDay Atlanta 2016

We're excited to hear about what you want to share with the Atlanta Jupyter community. Let's get some things straight:

## JupyterDay should be...
- **educational**
- **inclusive**
- **positive**
- **engaging**

## Ground Rules
- Github is a **public space**, and your words will be visible to everyone, so **be professional**!
- Crow about your **open source project** (that anyone can download and use) as much as you like, but no **excessive vendor plugging**

## The organizers of JupyterDay Atlanta will...
- moderate issues and comments in case of violation of the ground rules
- determine the final conference content and schedule to bring the best programming for **all attendees**
